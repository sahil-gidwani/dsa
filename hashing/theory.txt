In Java, hashing time complexity and space complexity depend on the specific data structure being used, such as HashMap, HashSet, or Hashtable. Here's a breakdown of time and space complexities for these common hashing data structures:

HashMap and HashSet:
Time Complexity:
Average Case (amortized): O(1) for insertion, deletion, and retrieval of elements.
Worst Case: In Java 8 and later versions, the worst-case time complexity for these operations is O(log n) due to the usage of red-black trees for collision handling. In Java 7 and earlier versions, the worst-case time complexity is O(n) when a lot of collisions occur and the internal linked lists grow too long. The rehashing process is triggered to maintain a good average case, which involves copying elements to a new larger array, making it O(n) in some cases.
Space Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the HashMap or HashSet. The space complexity is linear in the number of elements as each element requires an entry in the underlying data structure.


Both HashMap and HashSet in Java are implemented based on hash tables, which use an array combined with linked lists (in Java 8 and earlier versions) or red-black trees (in Java 8 and later versions) to manage key-value pairs (HashMap) or unique elements (HashSet).

HashMap:
The HashMap class in Java is used to store key-value pairs in which each key is unique. The keys are hashed to find their respective index in the underlying array, which allows for efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations.
Internally, a HashMap uses an array of Node objects (known as a bucket array) to store the key-value pairs. Each Node contains the key, value, and a reference to the next Node in case of collisions.
The hashing function converts the key's hash code into an index within the array. If multiple keys have the same index (collision), the elements are stored as a linked list (or a red-black tree in Java 8+).
When the number of elements in a bucket exceeds a certain threshold, the linked list is transformed into a red-black tree for better performance.
The HashMap automatically resizes its internal array (rehashing) when the load factor exceeds a specific threshold, ensuring a relatively constant time complexity for most operations.

HashSet:
The HashSet class in Java is used to store a collection of unique elements. It ensures that each element is unique by utilizing the same hash table concept as HashMap.
Internally, a HashSet uses a HashMap to store elements as keys and uses a common dummy value (such as private static final Object PRESENT = new Object();) as the value for all keys. This approach leverages the key uniqueness property of a HashMap to ensure unique elements in a HashSet.
When adding an element to the HashSet, it is converted into a key in the underlying HashMap, and the dummy value is associated with that key.
The hash code of each element is used to compute its index within the HashMap, similar to how it works in HashMap.
Like HashMap, HashSet automatically resizes its internal HashMap when the load factor exceeds a certain threshold.
It's worth noting that in Java 8 and later versions, HashMap and HashSet use tree structures (red-black trees) for bucket collisions when the number of elements in a bucket exceeds a certain threshold. This improves the time complexity of certain operations from O(n) to O(log n) in the worst-case scenarios.

In summary, both HashMap and HashSet use hash tables internally to provide fast access and storage of elements. HashMap stores key-value pairs, whereas HashSet stores unique elements. They are widely used in Java for their efficiency in handling large datasets and providing constant-time average case performance for most operations.
