2. You are given n numbers, where ith number represents price of stock on ith day.
3. You are required to print the maximum profit you can make if you are allowed infinite transactions.
Note - There can be no overlapping transaction. One transaction needs to be closed (a buy followed by a sell) before opening another transaction (another buy)
